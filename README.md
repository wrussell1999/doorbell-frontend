# IoT Doorbell

Why buy a doorbell, when you can just make your own?

[Justin](https://github.com/jedevc) and I live together and were struggling to hear people knocking on the door when we're working, so we decided to build our own door bell using a Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 3 and Flutter to allow us to get notifications on all of our devices.

## Setup
